# GCUf24PROJECT
Included in this repository are all software files required for the GCU F24 MEng Project. ; 

- Arduino Nano AtMega328 code 
- Android App Source Code plus .apk for Android App 

- Two Python codes included for viewing of serial monitor data in 1) numerical and  2) graph format.

***Current sensor code needs editing/new current sensor required. (Verifies and Uploads but not working with WCS1700)

***App displaying Brake Temperature, but Arduino code for LCD Screen now displays Battery Temperature.

a - The original PCB design gerber zip is included (PCB_Sensor circuit design 1.zip)

b -  Updated PCB Design Gerber zip files included for future PCB manufacturing; one with new filtering (for H.E, LCD and Power regulator) (PCB_Sensor circuit design2.zip) 

c - one with trial single power in (requires NMH2412S voltage sensor)) (PCB_Sensor circuit design 3.zip) (would require change in code to correctly monitor battery%)

(Schematics and PCB files to follow to allow for editing of PCB layout and design)

All aspects are imperfect due to lack of experience, but are operating and connecting, but i do admit they require some streamlining and further developement. This will be done over time. Feel free to play about.


any questions or enquieries, please contact jamie.warnock@hotmail.co.uk
