# GCUf24PROJECT
Arduino Nano AtMega328 code and Android App Code plus .apk for Android App for GCU F24 MEng Project.

Two Python codes included for viewing of serial monitor data in numerical and graph format.

Current sensor code needs editing/new current sensor required. (Verifies and Uploads but not working with WCS1700)
App displaying Brake Temperature, but Arduino code for LCD Screen now displays Battery Temperature.

Update PCB Designd Gerber files included for future PCB manufacturing (one with new filtering (for H.E, LCD and Power regulator), one with trial single power in (requires NMH2412S voltage sensor))

Both aspects are imperfect due to lack of experience, but are operating and connecting, but i do admit they require some streamlining and further developement. This will be done over time. Feel free to play about.



Thanks!
